feathers-can-react-starter (Client App)

This is a starter client app that uses the following:

 - [Feathers client](https://docs.feathersjs.com/clients/feathers.html): connectivity
 - [feathers-reactive](https://github.com/feathersjs/feathers-reactive): RxJS observable services
 - [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/): view layer with custom components
 - [@BigAB/can-react](https://github.com/BigAB/can-react): state management (in place of Mobx or Redux)
 - [canjs-feathers](https://github.com/feathersjs/canjs-feathers): connect model-layer state to `feathers-client`
 - [can-route](https://github.com/canjs/can-route): advanced, state-based routing
 - [StealJS](http://stealjs.com/): package management with hot module swap
 - [semistandard](https://github.com/Flet/semistandard): linting tool based on JsLint (similar to [standard](https://github.com/feross/standard), but with semicolons)
